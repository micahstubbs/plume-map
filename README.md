#Plume Map for NBC Bay Area

This plume map interactively shows the sites of toxic chemical plumes in Santa Clara County, CA. Toxic chemicals left by old Silicon Valley companies in the 1980s still remain in the earth. Some of those chemicals are still slowly rising through the soil and groundwater via a process called vapor intrusion.
